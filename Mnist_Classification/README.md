**MNIST classification** 
MNIST is like "HELLO WORLD Program of Machine learning".

Here MNIST is implemented with Binary Classifier to know about Best metric system
1) To have better understanding about Recall, Precision and F1 Score
2) To have better understanding of Confusion Matric and How plot of confusion matrix helps to identify misprediction values.

and Also MNIST is implemented with KNearestClassifier class to compare metrics with Binary Classifier.

I am following **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems** book to have core understanding of machine learning algorithms and it is also most suggested book for absolute beginners.
